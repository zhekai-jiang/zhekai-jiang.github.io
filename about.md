I am currently a third-year, or U2, undergraduate student at McGill University, majoring in software engineering at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Meanwhile, I am a research assistant focusing on model-based software and systems engineering. I am also engaged in some teaching activities as a [Tomlinson Engagement Awardee for Mentoring (TEAM Mentor or TEAMster)](https://www.mcgill.ca/tpulse/tomlinson-engagement-award-mentoring-team) in the course [MATH 133 Linear Algebra and Geometry](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/math-133) and a grader in [ECSE 321 Introduction to Software Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/ecse-321).

My current interests lie mainly in the following three aspects:

* **Software development and project management.** It is simply great fun to create new software of my own! Through a variety of courses and projects in the past years, I have been familiarized with common skills and practice in software engineering. I have experience with full-stack development, and have been exposed to different stages of software development, from requirement specification and development to validation and maintenance. In particular, I have been familar and comfortable with the agile project management pattern.
* **Theory of computation and programming languages, formal logic and reasoning, and model-based engineering.** This interest of mine was only discovered after I took a few relevant courses ([Programming Languages and Paradigms](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-302), [Theory of Computation](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-330), [Model-Based Programming](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/ecse-223), and [Discrete Structures](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/math-240)). It is very delightful to see the elegance of these theories and their relation to other seemingly unrelated areas such as system architecture, software validation, security, and even philosophy and art (Yes, I am reading *Gödel Escher Bach*).
* **Interdisciplinary applications.** I have learned about and have experience with mathematical modeling and some numerical computing techniques at high school and during my visiting at the University of Hong Kong. I am now taking the course [Applied Machine Learning](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-551) to study more about this, after laying all the foundations such as linear algebra, calculus, differential equations, probability theory, and statistics. I also keep an eye on a few other areas I am interested in and could potentially link my knowledge of software engineering to, such as economics and finance (I had courses like [Engineering Economy](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/facc-300) and [McGill Personal Finance Essentials](https://mcgillpersonalfinance.com)); music and acoustics (I took [Physics of Music](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/phys-224) and am reading *Gödel Escher Bach*); and physiology and psychology (I studied Advanced Placement (AP) Psychology myself before entering McGill).

I am actively seeking for opportunities of both internship in the industry and research in the academia related to computer science and software engineering. I do look forward to having more opportunities to cooperate with more people and apply my knowledge and skills to make some real contributions.

**Collaborators**: Wen (Amelia) Cui, Linpei (Angelina) Duan, Zheyan Tu, and Tianyu Zhao   
* In a team of five, we developed a software system, including the backend, a website, and an Android application, for an imaginary art gallery which was being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and transforming their business online. This will allow posting, browsing, promoting, and purchasing artwork remotely.
* The project is primarily in Java, with Javascript, CSS, and HTML used for the web frontend. The backend and frontend website are deployed on Heroku respectively. We follow the scrum-based agile project management. The project is managed using Git and GitHub, and uses Travis CI for continuous integration.
* During the development, I
  * served as one of the primary designers of the domain model,
  * implemented part of the business service layer and REST APIs along with respective unit testing and integration testing,
  * implemented the web and Android frontend of the pages for account information and management (including viewing and updating information of purchases, uploaded art pieces, deliveries, and frequently used addresses),
  * configured continuous integration with Travis CI and deployment of frontend website to Heroku,
  * contributed to bug fixing throughout the development, and
  * helped edit, manage, and organize the backlog and documentations on GitHub.

### Kingdomino Application

**Course Project of ECSE 223 Model-Based Programming**, Jan 2020 -- Apr 2020   
**Collaborators**: Matthew Caccavelli, Ezra Gomolin, Ricky Liu, and Gregory Walfish
* In a team of five, we developed a software with graphical user interface for the game Kingdomino, using object-oriented and behaviour-driven development in Java, following the model-view-controller pattern. The models were specified with Umple and Yakindu, and the entire project was managed using Git and GitHub.
* I worked on the primary design for the domain model and state machine model, was responsible for verification features and part of the graphical user interface for the main gameplay, and helped with other team members’ issues and the merging of code throughout the development.
