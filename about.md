I am currently a third-year, or U2, undergraduate student at McGill University, majoring in software engineering at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Meanwhile, I am a research assistant focusing on model-based software and systems engineering. I am also engaged in some teaching activities as a [Tomlinson Engagement Awardee for Mentoring (TEAM Mentor or TEAMster)](https://www.mcgill.ca/tpulse/tomlinson-engagement-award-mentoring-team) in the course [MATH 133 Linear Algebra and Geometry](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/math-133) and a grader in [ECSE 321 Introduction to Software Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/ecse-321).

My current interests lie mainly in the following three aspects:

* **Software development and project management.** It is simply great fun to create new software of my own! Through a variety of courses and projects in the past years, I have been familiarized with common skills and practice in software engineering. I have experience with full-stack development, and have been exposed to different stages of software development, from requirement specification and development to validation and maintenance. In particular, I have been familar and comfortable with the agile project management pattern.
* **Theory of computation and programming languages, formal logic and reasoning, and model-based engineering.** This interest of mine was only discovered after I took a few relevant courses ([Programming Languages and Paradigms](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-302), [Theory of Computation](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-330), [Model-Based Programming](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/ecse-223), and [Discrete Structures](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/math-240)). It is very delightful to see the elegance of these theories and their relation to other seemingly unrelated areas such as system architecture, software validation, security, and even philosophy and art (Yes, I am reading *Gödel Escher Bach*).
* **Interdisciplinary applications.** I have learned about and have experience with mathematical modeling and some numerical computing techniques at high school and during my visiting at the University of Hong Kong. I am now taking the course [Applied Machine Learning](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-551) to study more about this, after laying all the foundations such as linear algebra, calculus, differential equations, probability theory, and statistics. As a TEAMster in MATH 133, I post [write-ups](linear-algebra) about interesting applications of linear algebra in other areas of mathematics, computer science, etc. I also keep an eye on a few other areas I am interested in and could potentially link my knowledge of software engineering to, such as economics and finance (I had courses like [Engineering Economy](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/facc-300) and [McGill Personal Finance Essentials](https://mcgillpersonalfinance.com)); music and acoustics (I took [Physics of Music](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/phys-224) and am reading *Gödel Escher Bach*); and physiology and psychology (I studied Advanced Placement (AP) Psychology myself before entering McGill).

I am actively seeking for opportunities of both internship in the industry and research in the academia related to computer science and software engineering. I do look forward to having more opportunities to cooperate with more people and apply my knowledge and skills to make some real contributions.
