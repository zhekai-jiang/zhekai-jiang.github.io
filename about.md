I am currently an undergraduate student at McGill University, majoring in software engineering at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. During the summer of 2022, I am a visiting Excellence Research Intern at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).

My current interests lie mainly in **model-based and formal methods of software engineering, ontology and conceptual modelling, automated reasoning, and programming languages**. Supervised by [Prof. Dániel Varró](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/daniel-varro), I research on design space exploration, languages for model specification and graph query, graph model generation, and model visualization and simulation, to be applied mostly in design and formal verifications of critical and cyber-physical systems. During my research internship at EPFL, supervised by [Prof. Christoph Koch](https://people.epfl.ch/christoph.koch) at the [DATA Analysis Theory and Applications (DATA) Laboratory](https://data.epfl.ch), I research on algorithms based on probabilistic graphical models to approximate results of data queries with projection/aggregation operations, for the core query engine of [Sudokube](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/292499), an online analytical processing (OLAP) database system for data scientists, based on partially materialized high-dimensional data cubes. In the past semesters, I also took a few related courses such as [Programming Languages and Paradigms](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-302), [Theory of Computation](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-330), [Model-Based Programming](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/ecse-223), and [Discrete Structures](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/math-240).

I am also interested in **industrial software development and project management**. It is always a pleasure to develop software to be used by other people and to make impacts. I am familiar with common skills and practice in software engineering. I have experience with full-stack development and have been exposed to the different stages of software engineering, from requirements elicitation and development to validation and maintenance. In particular, I am familar and comfortable with the agile project management pattern.

I am actively seeking for opportunities of both research in the academia and internship in the industry related to computer science and software engineering. I do look forward to having more opportunities to cooperate with more people and apply my knowledge and skills to make some real contributions.
