<br/>

I am currently an undergraduate student of software engineering at McGill University. During the summer of 2022, I am a visiting Excellence Research Intern at EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne) in Switzerland.

My current research interests include **model-based and formal methods of software engineering, ontology and conceptual modelling, automated reasoning, and theories of database systems**. Supervised by [Prof. Dániel Varró](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/daniel-varro) at McGill, I research on graph model specification, query, transformation, simulation, and visualization, to be applied mostly in the model-based design and formal verification of critical and cyber-physical systems. During my research internship at EPFL, supervised by [Prof. Christoph Koch](https://people.epfl.ch/christoph.koch) at the [DATA Analysis Theory and Applications (DATA) Laboratory](https://data.epfl.ch), I research on algorithms based on probabilistic graphical models to approximate results of data queries with projection/aggregation operations, for the core query engine of [Sudokube](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/292499), an online analytical processing (OLAP) database system for data scientists, based on partially materialized high-dimensional data cubes. I recently also participated in another project about causality reasoning and root cause analysis for events in semi-quantitative simulations of realistic scenarios.

I am also interested in **industrial software development and project management**. I am familiar with common skills and practice in software engineering. I have experience with full-stack development and have been exposed to the overall process of software engineering, from requirements elicitation and development to verification and maintenance. In particular, I am familar and comfortable with the agile project management methodology.

I actively seek for opportunities of both academic research and industrial research and development related to computer science and software engineering. I do look forward to more such opportunities to cooperate and to apply my knowledge and skills to make impactful contributions.
