I am currently a third-year, or U2, undergraduate student at McGill University, majoring in software engineering at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Meanwhile, I am a research assistant focusing on model-based software and systems engineering. I am also engaged in some teaching activities as a [Tomlinson Engagement Awardee for Mentoring (TEAM Mentor or TEAMster)](https://www.mcgill.ca/tpulse/tomlinson-engagement-award-mentoring-team) in the course [MATH 133 Linear Algebra and Geometry](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/math-133) and a grader in [ECSE 321 Introduction to Software Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/ecse-321).

My current interests lie mainly in the following three aspects:

* **Model-based software engineering, formal methods, programming languages, and automated reasoning.** Supervised by [Prof. Dániel Varró](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/daniel-varro), I am researching on design space exploration, languages for model specification and graph query, graph model generation, and model visualization and simulation. I also took a few related courses such as [Programming Languages and Paradigms](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/comp-302), [Theory of Computation](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-330), [Model-Based Programming](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/ecse-223), and [Discrete Structures](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/math-240). It is very delightful to see the elegance of these theories, their applications in system design and validation, and even their relation and illusions to seemingly unrelated areas such as philosophy and art.

* **Mathematical modelling, machine learning, and their interdisciplinary applications.** I have learned about and have experience with mathematical modelling and some numerical computing techniques at high school and during my visiting at the University of Hong Kong. I am now taking a graduate-level course [Applied Machine Learning](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/comp-551) to study more about this. I also keep an eye on a few other areas I am interested in and could potentially link my knowledge to, such as economics and finance, music and acoustics, and physiology and psychology.

* **Software development and project management.** It is great fun to create software of my own! Through a variety of courses and projects in the past years, I have been familiarized with common skills and practice in software engineering. I have experience with full-stack development, and have been exposed to different stages of software development, from requirement specification and development to validation and maintenance. In particular, I have been familar and comfortable with the agile project management pattern.

I am actively seeking for opportunities of both research in the academia and internship in the industry related to computer science and software engineering. I do look forward to having more opportunities to cooperate with more people and apply my knowledge and skills to make some real contributions.
