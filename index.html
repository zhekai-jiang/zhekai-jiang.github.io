<p>Hello! 你好! Bonjour!</p>

<p>I am currently an undergraduate student of software engineering internship program at McGill University in Canada. I am actively engaged in research and teaching activities at McGill as a research assistant at the Critical Software-Intensive Group and as a <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/tpulse/tomlinson-engagement-award-mentoring-team">TEAM Mentor</a> or teaching assistant in multiple courses. During the summer of 2022, I was a visiting Excellence Research Intern at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/data/">Data Analysis Theory and Applications (DATA) Laboratory</a> of EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne) in Switzerland.</p>

<p>More information about me is available in <a href="about">About</a> and my <a href="cv/cv.pdf">curriculum vitae in PDF format</a>. Also feel free to check out some work I wish to showcase in the tabs <a href="projects">Project Portfolio</a> and <a href="linear-algebra">Linear Algebra</a>!
