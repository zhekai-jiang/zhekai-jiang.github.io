<p>Hello! 你好! Bonjour!</p>

<p>I am currently a third-year, or U2, undergraduate student at McGill University, majoring in software engineering at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Meanwhile, I am a research assistant focusing on model-based software and systems engineering. I am also engaged in some teaching activities as a Tomlinson Engagement Awardee for Mentoring (TEAM Mentor or TEAMster) at MATH 133 Linear Algebra and Geometry and a grader at ECSE 321 Introduction to Software Engineering.</p>

<p>More information about me is available in <a href="about">About</a> and my <a href="cv/cv.pdf">2-page curriculum vitae in PDF format</a>. This website is not yet quite complete, and I may add new sections and even start to write posts at times. Feel free to hang around here, and do not hesitate if you wish to contact me on LinkedIn or email!</p>
