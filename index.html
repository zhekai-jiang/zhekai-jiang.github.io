<p>Hello! 你好! Bonjour! Hallo!</p>

<p>I am currently an undergraduate student of software engineering internship program at McGill University in Montréal, Canada. I have been actively engaged in research, development, and teaching activities. From January to August 2023, I was an intern at <a href="https://labs.oracle.com">Oracle Labs</a> in Zürich, Switzerland. In the summer of 2022, I was a visiting Excellence Research Intern at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/data/">Data Analysis Theory and Applications (DATA) Laboratory</a> of EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne) in Lausanne, Switzerland. With my international experiences, I am also a <a href="https://mcgill.ca/iea">McGill International Experience Awards (MIEA)</a> Ambassador, who actively endorses and advocates participation in international exchange activities.

<p>My current interests include <b>(1) model-driven and formal methods of software design and analysis; (2) metaphysical, ontological, and conceptual modelling of objects, data, and design; (3) development tools and services, DevOps, quality assurance, and industrial software project management; and (4) database systems and data management</b>. Advised by <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/daniel-varro">Prof. Dániel Varró</a> at McGill, I researched on graph model specification, query, transformation, simulation, and visualization, to be applied mostly in the model-based design, formal verification, and design tool certification for critical and cyber-physical systems. During my research internship at EPFL, supervised by <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/christoph.koch">Prof. Christoph Koch</a> at the <a href="https://data.epfl.ch">DATA Analysis Theory and Applications (DATA) Laboratory</a>, I worked on the project <a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/292499">Sudokube</a>, a newly proposed online analytical processing (OLAP) database system for data scientists, based on partially-materialized pre-computed high-dimensional data cubes.</p>

<p>I am also interested in <b>industrial software development, DevOps, quality assurance, and project management for software engineering</b>, as well as similar techniques to <b>bridge research productions to realistic industrial use cases</b>. During my internship at Oracle Labs, I worked on the GraalVM download service which simplifies and secures the download and integration of GraalVM in the workflow of application development in the GraalVM ecosystem.</p>
    
<p>I actively seek for opportunities of both academic research and industrial research and development related to the above areas of computer science and software engineering. I do look forward to more such opportunities to cooperate and to apply my knowledge and skills to make impactful contributions.
