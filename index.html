<p>Hello! 你好! Bonjour! Hallo!</p>

<p>I am currently an undergraduate student of software engineering internship program at McGill University in Montréal, Canada. I have been actively engaged in research and teaching activities. From January to August 15, 2023, I am a research intern of open-source corporate architecture solutions and services (OCASS) at <a href="https://labs.oracle.com">Oracle Labs</a> in Zürich, Switzerland. During the summer of 2022, I was a visiting Excellence Research Intern at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/data/">Data Analysis Theory and Applications (DATA) Laboratory</a> of EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne) in Lausanne, Switzerland. With these experiences of international exchange, I am also a <a href="https://mcgill.ca/iea">McGill International Experience Awards (MIEA)</a> Ambassador, who actively and passionately endorses and promotes participation in international exchange activities.</p>

<p>More information about me is available in <a href="about">About</a> and my <a href="cv/cv.pdf">curriculum vitae in PDF format</a>. Also feel free to check out some work I wish to showcase in the tabs <a href="projects">Project Portfolio</a> and <a href="linear-algebra">Linear Algebra</a>!
