In the Fall 2021 semester, I am a [Tomlinson Engagement Awardee for Mentoring (TEAM Mentor or TEAMster)](https://www.mcgill.ca/tpulse/tomlinson-engagement-award-mentoring-team) in the course [MATH 133 Linear Algebra and Geometry](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/math-133) at McGill University. I am tasked to post some write-ups about interesting applications of linear algebra in other areas of mathematics, computer science, etc., corresponding to the progress of the course. Below are the ones I have done, and it is to be continued as the semester goes.

* [Performing Gaussian Elimination Programmatically](performing-gaussian-elimination-programmatically)
* [Representing Images and Colours in Computers](representing-images-and-colours-in-computers)
* [How Computers Multiply HUGE Matrices](how-computers-multiply-huge-matrices)
* [Generalizing Transformations](generalizing-transformations)
