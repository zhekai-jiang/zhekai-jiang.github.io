In the Fall 2021 semester, I was a [Tomlinson Engagement Awardee for Mentoring (TEAM Mentor or TEAMster)](https://www.mcgill.ca/tpulse/tomlinson-engagement-award-mentoring-team) in the course [MATH 133 Linear Algebra and Geometry](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2021-2022/courses/math-133) at McGill University. I was tasked to post write-ups about interesting applications and connections of linear algebra to other areas of mathematics, computer science, etc., corresponding to the progress of the course. Below are their archive, and feed free to have a look if you are interested!
