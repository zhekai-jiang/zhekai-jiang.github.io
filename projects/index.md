## À l'heure

**Winner of the Best AI for Commerce (Stonks) at [MAIS Hacks 2021](https://mais-hacks-2021.devpost.com) hosted by McGill Artificial Intelligence Society**, Oct 2–3, 2021

**Collaborators**: Junjian Chen, Xichong Ling, and Shichang Zhang

[Application](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~zjiang27/projects/alheure) \| [Devpost Presentation](https://devpost.com/software/smart-delay) \| [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zhekai-jiang/alheure)

* In a team of four, using almost 500,000 data points from the dataset "2019 Airline Delays w/Weather and Airport Detail" on Kaggle, we trained a decision tree model to predict whether a flight will delay based on five parameters the user enters. The model is persistently stored in a Flask-based backend server deployed on Heroku to which the frontend will make HTTP requests to perform prediction. The frontend is based on HTML and CSS, and the result of the prediction will be displayed after the user requests to predict.

* Throughout the development, I contributed to the ideation of the project, developed and deployed the HTML frontend and Flask backend onto remote servers, and conducted the oral presentation and live demonstration.

## Be My Chef

**[Morgan Stanley 2021 Code to Give MTL Hackathon](https://codetogive.bemyapp.com/)**, Sep 13–20, 2021   

**Collaborators**: Anthony Zhao, Eric Zhang, Jessica Yang, Frédéric Pelletier, Jia Ming Wei, and Louis Waked (Team Mentor)

[BeMyApp Presentation](https://codetogive.bemyapp.com/#/projects/6147e69b880a5d002da2d2e6) \| [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/zhekai-jiang/BeMyChefPWA)   

* In a team of six, we analyzed requirements, identified features, designed software prototypes, developed functional components in React, and proposed recommendations on implementation and future work for a new software project of La Tablée des Chefs aimed at encouraging teenagers to create and share food recipes, learn about healthy eating, and encourage food sustainability.
* I contributed to ideation of requirements, features, and prototypes; developed the page displaying information of recipes and a search-by-available-ingredients feature in JavaScript using React; helped compile texts and graphics for documentations on GitHub and BeMyApp; and proposed recommendations for implementation.

## Pocket McGill

**Major Group Project in the course [CCOM 206 Communication in Engineering](https://mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/ccom-206)**, Mar 2021 – Apr 2021   

**Collaborators**: Justin Legrand, Mohamed Amine El-Felsoufi, Ping Gu, Ramin Akhavan-Sarraf, and Sébastien Cantin
* In a team of six, as an imaginary startup software engineering company, we compiled a business proposal to McGill University in both a written document and a live presentation. It involves a new one-stop mobile application for McGill students to conveniently access all services needed for their academic lives.
* I served as a senior software engineer in the company, addressing details on the implementation of the application, including the system architecture and project management plans.

## Artizon

**Course Project in [ECSE 321 Introduction to Software Engineering](https://mcgill.ca/study/2020-2021/courses/ecse-321)**, Sep 2020 – Nov 2020   

**Collaborators**: Wen (Amelia) Cui, Linpei (Angelina) Duan, Zheyan Tu, and Tianyu Zhao   

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2020/project-group-09)   
* In a team of five, we developed a software system, including the backend, a website, and an Android application, for an imaginary art gallery which was being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and transforming their business online. This will allow posting, browsing, promoting, and purchasing artwork remotely.
* The project is primarily in Java, with Javascript, CSS, and HTML used for the web frontend. The backend and frontend website are deployed on Heroku respectively. We follow the scrum-based agile project management. The project is managed using Git and GitHub, and uses Travis CI for continuous integration.
* During the development, I
  * served as one of the primary designers of the domain model,
  * implemented part of the business service layer and REST APIs along with respective unit testing and integration testing,
  * implemented the web and Android frontend of the pages for account information and management (including viewing and updating information of purchases, uploaded art pieces, deliveries, and frequently used addresses),
  * configured continuous integration with Travis CI and deployment of frontend website to Heroku,
  * contributed to bug fixing throughout the development, and
  * helped edit, manage, and organize the backlog and documentations on GitHub.

## Kingdomino

**Course Project in [ECSE 223 Model-Based Programming](https://mcgill.ca/study/2019-2020/courses/ecse-223)**, Jan 2020 -- Apr 2020   

**Collaborators**: Matthew Caccavelli, Ezra Gomolin, Ricky Liu, and Gregory Walfish
* In a team of five, we developed a software with graphical user interface for the game Kingdomino, using object-oriented and behaviour-driven development in Java, following the model-view-controller pattern. The models were specified with Umple and Yakindu, and the entire project was managed using Git and GitHub.
* I worked on the primary design for the domain model and state machine model, was responsible for verification features and part of the graphical user interface for the main gameplay, and helped with other team members’ issues and the merging of code throughout the development.

## The Best Hospital
[**Finalist of the Greater China Region at the International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IMMC 2018) International Contest**](http://istem.info/ueditor/php/upload/file/20180510/1525965614903123.pdf), Mar 2018 – Apr 2018   

Published in journal *Maths, Physics, and Chemistry for Middle School Students*. Available on [China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)](https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&dbname=CJFDLASN2019&filename=ZLXY201812020&v=Mjc0NTExVDNxVHJXTTFGckNVUjdxZmJ1WnVGaW5oVTc3S1B5SFRkN0c0SDluTnJZOUhaSVI4ZVgxTHV4WVM3RGg=) (in Chinese only).   

**Collaborators**: Ruijia Chen, Weijia Huang, Chuxiang Lin, and Ziqian Li (Teacher Advisor)

* In a team of four, we developed a mathematical model that uses various factors to measure the quality of hospitals and determine the best hospital. We also wrote a memo that a person without much mathematical expertise or computing ability can use to choose a hospital.
* We were invited for a live presentation and oral defence at the regional final of Greater China.
* I contributed to the overall design of the mathematical model, developed all the computer programs in MATLAB and C++, and edited part of the solution paper for the contest and subsequent publication.
